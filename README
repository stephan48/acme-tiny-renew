-- Configuration --
The configuration is quite simple and consits of a single .ini file called renew.ini.
This file has to be placed next to the script. In future versions we will allow a selection by parameter.

The important keys are:
[general] -> domains which holds a space seperated list of domains for which we want certificates.

Additionally you can specify a section with the same name as one of the key in domains and add a san= key to automatically generate a certificate with multiply subjectaltnames.

When the configuration is done you should make sure that the propper Aliases/Location blocks are defined in Nginx/Apache2 so the corresponding challenge response files will be found by the webservers. Refer to acme-tiny documentation for that.

-- Generated File Structure --

All files will be generated in the script directory if missing:

domain.tld.key.pem - private key
domain.tld.cfg.pem - openssl config
domain.tld.csr.pem - cert request
domain.tld.crt.pem - cert
domain.tld.intermediate.pem - intermediate ca
domain.tld.chained.pem - cert+intermediate

-- Usage --
Simply run the tool. It will automatically generate keys and requests if none are found.
It will then hand the major work to acme-tiny and will just do some minor dump-to-file logic.

On a successive run it will read the certificate expiry and only regenerate the cert if it will expire within the next 30 days.

-- Installation --

1. Make sure the openssl binary is in path
2. git clone https://vcs.stejau.de/stephan/acme-tiny-renew
3. git submodule update --recursive --init
4 <-config edit->
5. python renew.py
6. ???
7. PROFIT
